# Text-to-Speech-Pronunciation-with-Python
Text-to-Speech Pronunciation with Python (using espeak) - Used and Ran in Ubuntu
In this particular code, I am using my first name and my last fake name to turn it into a speech. A robotic voice will call out your name. So that's pretty cool. And a little creepy.
Make sure to install espeak beforehand. Run this in your terminal - sudo apt-get install espeak
